Built a full-stack Loan Management Application, reducing manual tracking by 70% and
providing users with a dashboard that improved loan data accessibility and reporting efficiency for 
small and medium loan vendors.

Primarily designed for one of our local clients. Client usage was for only 15k transaction in a day 
where our simple design could have handled more than 70k-100k transactions in a day.
